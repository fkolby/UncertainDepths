-Ran experiment on Cluster, running for 80 epochs giving at least qualitatively adequate results.
- Started nnj migration.

6. October:
- Should forward be seperately implemented?
- Can the modules get the respective methods, in new nomenclature - what about when propagating?
- Inconsistencies for val == none in nnj?
