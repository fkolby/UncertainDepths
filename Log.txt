5 October:
-Ran experiment on Cluster, running for 80 epochs giving at least qualitatively adequate results.
- Started nnj migration.

6. October:
- Should forward be seperately implemented?
- Can the modules get the respective methods, in new nomenclature - what about when propagating?
- Inconsistencies for val == none in nnj?
- Am I evaluating correctly; when i only give loss on cropped (352x704) images? Final eval is of course on 352x704
Goal for today: "copy paste in nnj and try to run laplace with it." GOAL NOT COMPLETED: RAN INTO ISSUES WITH TEST; REQUIRES ME TO UNDERSTAND THE DIMENSIONALITY OF THE TEST.
